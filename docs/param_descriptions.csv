name,type,description
star_name,str,Name of directory to create model in. All spectra will be stored in \verb|./star_name/|
star_teff,float,\teff~of the star in K
star_teff_min,float,Minimum temperature spectrum to include in binning
star_teff_max,float,Maximum temperature spectrum to include in binning
star_spot_initial_coverage,float,Spot coverage to begin with. This should only be used when spot timescales are much longer than the length of the observation.
star_spot_distribution,str,Method to distribute spots. \verb|iso| or \verb|solar|
star_spot_mean_area,float,Mean peak starspot area in MSH
star_spot_sigma_area,float,Lognormal sigma for mean peak starspot area in dex

star_spot_penumbra_teff,float,\teff~of the spot penumbra
star_spot_growth_rate,float,Fractional growth of spot area in day$^{-1}$. 0 means no growth.
star_spot_decay_rate,float,Decay rate of spots in MSH day$^{-1}$. 0 means no decay.
star_spot_initial_area,float,Initial area for newly birthed spots in MSH
star_spot_coverage,float,Desired fractional surface coverage of star spots in growth-decay equilibrium

star_fac_coverage,float,Desired fractional surface coverage of faculae in growth-decay equilibrium
star_fac_mean_radius,float,Mean peak facula radius in km
star_fac_HWMH_radius,float,Facula radius distribution half-width-half-maximum in km. Difference between the peak of the radius distribution and the half maximum in the positive direction
star_fac_mean_timescale,float,Mean facula timescale in hr.
star_fac_HWMH_timescale,float,Facula timescale distribution half-width-half-maximum in hr. Difference between the peak of the timescale distribution and the half maximum in the positive direction
star_fac_distribution,str,Method to distribute faculae. Currently only \verb|iso| is supported.
star_fac_warmup,float, Time (in hr) to ``warm up'' the star to reach growth-decay equilibrium
