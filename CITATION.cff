  VSPEC (Variable Star PhasE Curve) is an exoplanet modeling
  suite that combines NASAâ€™s Planetary Spectrum Generator
  (PSG) with a custom variable star (based on the spotty and
  xoflares packages).


  VSPEC is a general exoplanet observation modeling suite
  that is built to be modular. VSPEC can simulate phase
  curves of non-transiting planets, transits, eclipses, and
  direct-imaging spectroscopy. It uses a noise model from
  PSG, which is sophisticated enough to simulate realistic
  data for a variety of scenarios.


  The original motivation for VSPEC was to create synthetic
  datasets of Planetary Infrared Excess (PIE) observations,
  but the code is much more general.
