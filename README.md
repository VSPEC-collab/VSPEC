Variable Stellar Phase-Curve Analysis: Code that links variable stellar model output to GCM output to create a realistic synthetic data of a star/planet system. Returns spectra of the star, planet, and combined star/planet. The data sets will be used to create a method of separating the planet's flux (reflected and thermal) from the combined system flux as observed by a telescope, in order to study the planet's atmosphere based on its spectra.
